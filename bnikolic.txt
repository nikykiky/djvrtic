Thank you so much, thank you for coming
Probably should've, uh...
Ended it on a higher note
A big ending or whatever... But, uh...
That's the end of "what."
I hope you enjoyed it-
Bo, oh my god
How are you? I haven't seen you since, like, Freshman year!
Oh my God!
You were so, like, skinny and weird back then, uh...
But now you're, um...
Anyway, um..., you should totally come to this party
I'm having tonight with a bunch of my college friends
Um, it's gonna be off the chain-hook!
It's gonna be so good
You can play some songs for us, or something...
Um, I've been telling everybody
How good of friends we were
Um, back in the day...
Uhm, I know we never talked or hung out ever
But um...
I think that's what made our friendship so special
You know...
Anyway, text me!
Okay!
Bye!
Mister Burnham
How ya doin', good? Good!
Uh, I'm a, uh...
I'm an agent from out in Los Angeles
Uh, really dig your stuff man
It's out there
You know, I totally get it!
Uh, and the best part about it, man!
You've got all these young fans, uh, and...
Which is great, because young people, they're...
They're very passionate, and they're very...
Uh, they're very reliable consumers
But what you've gotta do to take your career to the next level?
You've gotta cater more heavily to them
Alright? We've done studies
Young people do not respond to this...
You know, "introspective" material
Or these "challenges-to-the-form", you know...
Young people want jokes they can relate to, okay?
So, write aâ€”write a silly song about Facebook, you know?
Write some jokes about Twitter, or...
Sugary cereals, or...
Razor scooters!
Relate to them!
You know, also
You've gotta reestablish your presence on the internet, buddy
Alright, it's not important whether your material's "good" or not
What's important is that you keep the Bo Burnham brand alive and well!
Ya get it? Cool-
But we'll discuss more later, I know it's a lot...
Uhh, my number is, uh, 310-555-uhh...
-Management-management-management...
Fag!
What up, dude, what's up, how are ya man?
You've changed, bro...
You've changed
I never knew you
But, um...
My friend's old roommate's friend said he knew you in high school
And, you became a real asshole once all this "comedy" stuff started happening
What, what is it man?
You think you're better than us?
You think you're better than us just cause you're tall?
Whoa, congrats man, you're tall!
Wow, it's incredible! Wo-
You want a trophy for being tall?
You wanna...
We should just give trophies to tall things
And every tree and building will have a trophy
That make sense?
Yo, why you acting all quiet and weird right now?
Yo, I know why you are
It's cause you're an arrogant prick
That's why, an arrogant fuckin' prick
I once heard that you actually act quiet
Cause you're shy and introverted in real life
And that people shouldn't expect you to-
Act the same way offstage as you do onstage
Haha! Yeah...
Yeah, it makes no sense...
Anyway, you wanna buy some weed?
